# Student Exam Performance Prediction

![Project Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/823a134f-319d-4e08-bb7f-5ca8d7b499bb)

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application built using Flask, which predicts the math score of students based on various features like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in reading and writing. The project follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and scale.

## Usage

1. Go to the homepage and navigate to the prediction form.
2. Fill in the required student details such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, etc.
3. Click on "Predict your Maths Score" to get the predicted score.

## Data Pipeline

### Data Ingestion

- **Source:** The data is read from a CSV file.
- **Processing:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### Data Transformation

- **Numerical Features:** Imputation of missing values and scaling.
- **Categorical Features:** Imputation, encoding, and scaling.

### Model Training

- **Models:** Various regression models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using RÂ² score and the best model is selected.

## Prediction Pipeline

The prediction pipeline includes loading the trained model and preprocessing objects to transform new data and make predictions.

## AWS Deployment

The project is deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk for scalable web app deployment. Below are the key steps and a few visuals illustrating the deployment:

1. **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**: The project uses AWS CodePipeline to automatically deploy new versions of the app whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
